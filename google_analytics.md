#### Learn the basic setup, navigation, and interface of Google Analytics
- Create Google A account. Use primary account. Don't let anyone else create your site's GA account under their own account so they can manage it for you. If they leave, they take all the data with them
#### Get acquainted with basic terminology and mathematical formulas to understand key metrics
- Get Tracking ID. This must be installed on every page of the website. Add to header.
- With a shopify e-comm store, paste in Online Store settings (same with tumblr)

#### Be able to identify the metrics that matter for your specific business case and how to use them to make educated decisions
- Audience Reports: tell you everything about your visitors. You will find detailed reports for age and gender (demographics), Interests, Location, Language, how often they visit (Behavior), and if they visited using mobile
- Acquisition Reports: These reports will tell you everything you want to know about what drove visitors to your website (All Traffic). You can learn everything about traffic from social networks (Social). You can connect GA to AdWords to learn more about PPC campaigns and to G Webmaster Tools/Search Console to learn more about search traffic (SEO)
- Behavior Reports: Tells you everything you want to know about your content. The top pages on your website (Site Content > All Pages), top entry pages on your website (Site Content > Landing Pages), and the top exist pages on your website (Site Content > Exit Pages)
- Conversions: If you set up Goals within GA, you can see how many conversions your website has received (Goals > Overview) and what URLS they happened upon (Goals > Goal URLS). You can also see the path that visitors took to complete the conversion (Goals > Reverse Goal Path)
#### Create custom segments, goals, URLs, and dashboards
- Goals setting will tell GA when something important has happened on website. Example: if you have a site where you generate leads through a contact form, you will want to find/create a thank you page that visitors end upon once they have submitted their contact information
- URL will look like : www.123bus.com/thank-you
